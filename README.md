## _September 13th Notes_
1. A computer is a clock with benefits
2. All software starts as code
3. code is 'computer language', computer language turns our people talk into something a computer can execute
4. A compiler compiles that code into a software than will run that code on command (like when you click a button on your DAW)
5. A compiler takes codes and breaks them down into smaller pieces
6. 90% of my coding errors will come from the fact that I missed one symbol or I told myself "oh that'll be fine the way it is" when in reality, that one symbol mattered and I will spend *years* debugging just to find out I found only one symbol was missing the whole time. (curse you syntax errors)
7. Computers use "trees" as a form of organization.
8. an Algorithm is a software that does a set job (like searching a database for a file or computing a number from an array)
