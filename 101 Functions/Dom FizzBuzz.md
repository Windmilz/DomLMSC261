#           FizzBuzz

## What did you do?
-  I coded a counter that counts whatever value you like (literally) and comments "fizz" for numbers divisible by 3, "buzz" divisible by 5 and "fizzbuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5
### How did you do it?
- Firstly I coded a counter. I wasnt sure how to go about it but then through the grace of these class examples it was shown to me that python has an integrated counter and I didnt need to make a while loop like I thought I did. For some reason the teacher made it print the input minus the chosen variable, so I was confused why that was there but then I realized if the teacher had just given us the answer then this would not be homework. The secret was to just print 'i' because 'i' is an integer.
### the problems you faced
- My biggest problem was short circuiting my code. I wanted to put the if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0 : print('FizzBuzz') at the end of my series of if else statements, but then it would never print "fizzbuzz" for numbers like 15, 45, and so on. I talked to my classmate (Marc) who revealed to me it was because I was an numpty and wasn't actually passing that code to my program because it was already printing either "fizz" or "buzz" and not reaching the "fizzbuzz" portion of the code. So all I did was move the "fizzbuzz" to the top of my if else statements and everything worked fine.
## Code you took from elsewhere
- I did take the counter from my Teacher, I sure hope she doesn't mind.
