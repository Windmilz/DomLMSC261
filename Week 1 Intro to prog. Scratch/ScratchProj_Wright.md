# what you did
  I created a little story game using sounds and honestly a lot more code than I expected out of this game
## how you did it
My process was kind of unorthodox, I built it like the 'story' would read. I started by programming what Scratch (the cat) would say, and then I would the specific part that correlated to what Scratch was referring to. I would also work through it by sequence. If I had a sound that triggered for one sprite, I went through and did all the sounds one after the other, If I needed sprites to appear or not, I would do all of that in one time, instead of building all the components of one sprite first and then moving on to the next one.

###    the problems you faced & how you overcame them
The only really problem was I was trying to figure out how to make the saxophone and Scratch move at the same time during the final sequence, but I accidentally came out with something that made me laugh uncontrollably for about 3 minutes so for the pure sake of comedy I decided to leave it like that.

#### what code you used from others/elsewhere where to find that code
Does this code belong to me? Is it property of MIT and/or Scratch? I guess this is more of a philosophical question.

##### If your problem set does not compile and run document all of the troubleshooting you did and the error messages you faced in the documentation.
