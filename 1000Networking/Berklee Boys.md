# Berklee Boys Website

# What did I do
- I created a very *spectacular* website in which me and my bandmates tell the world about ourselves in out amazing band, The Berkle√© Boys.

# How did I (we) do it?
- We had to create a website on Github.io (My repository was used for this atrocity but its funny so Im okay with it), and we sectioned off portions for us to work on indivually.

# What problems did we face
- The biggest problem was working out how to get everything to commit because boy was that a hassle. We realized pretty quickly that everyone trying to do it at once broke the commits, and That was unfun so instead we decided to do it in stages from top to bottom in the order that appears in the bios. Each person worked on their own bio, But JP implemented the Audio that I supplied, and claire worked on adding the image (which at the time of writing this may or may not be functioning, github io is slow to update sometimes). But as far as actual coding goes it was realatively smooth sailing. It was just the method we took in compiling all of our code twas not the fastest, but in the end it worked out pretty well.

# Did you use any code from anyone else?
- Actually, outside of the styles.css file from Rachel's Website, I did find an article that helped me make the audio loop when you played it for maximum tomfoolery

The premise of the whole code was to add "Looping" inside the <audio controls> so it will loop the audio, so all I had to do was add that into the audio controls.
