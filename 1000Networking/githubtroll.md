# Github Lurking

# What did I do
- I attempted to lurk in a Github repository relating to my final project
# How did I (we) do it?
- Well the plan was simple, Id simply find a fairly active repository and follow the commits, see what the team working on it was doing.
# What problems did we face
- The biggest problem was the fact that every repository I saw either was a one man army, or just didnt post anything over the week. Maybe it was terrible timing because it was Thanksgiving week but I could not find a single multi person repository that was doing anything over this week.

# Did you use any code from anyone else?
- I didnt see any code unfortunately. Everyone was out eating and giving thanks or something. No one wanted to code.
