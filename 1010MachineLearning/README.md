## Machine Learning
- Spam Folder
- Programming computers so they can learn from data (training data)
### Types of Machine Learning
  - Supervised (training data has all the answers)
  - Unsupervised (anomaly detection)
  - Semisupervised (partially labelled, looking for patterns)
  - Reinforcement learning (getting towards AI...like training a dog with positive and negative rewards)
### Modes
  - Batch learning (you get all the training data at once)
  - "Online" learning (system can accept new training data on the go)
  - Instance-based (commits training data to memory, then compares new data to training data)
  - Model-based (generalizes from a set of examples then uses that model to make predictions)
### Problems
  - Insufficient quantity of training data
  - Poor quality of training data
  - Non-representative training data

### AI
- Neural Networks
  - identifies + reproduces patterns in the same way a human brain does
  - used to be called "deep learning"
