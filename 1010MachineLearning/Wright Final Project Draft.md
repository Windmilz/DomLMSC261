## Idea
- To create a text based story rpg that is mostly decision based

I want build a world inside of a text based rpg (and probably release it on the internet) that is like popular games like undertale, but without the graphical element. Games like this exist out in the wild, but I wanted to make something the way I would play one, with a lot of chaos, and maybe even some mingus for the culture.

## Breakdown
So I decided I wanted to use JavaScript for this. It's a language I'm more versed in and is in my opinion a little more powerful when it comes to game building but I also just like it more and the packages were easier for me to google.

In doing my research to find a package that would help me, I stumbled upon the perfect package for my needs.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-rpg-engine/v/1.0.5

It seems fairly recent (unlike the python ones I saw which were published 2 or 3 years ago) and I couldnt actually find anything for Python 3, so that is also a reason I decided to go with JavaScript.

##A little bit of Psuedo code

I need to story board a full fledged story. My current small scale idea is for people to navigate the basements of Berklee Building 130 (and maybe even lean way into the Berklee Hogwarts comparison) where they venture through puzzles, monsters (of only the Jazziest stature) to get to their studio session on time.

Then I'd have to breakdown the order in which these events occur, but I want it to be less structured in terms of absolute order and more objective based, so there can be branches to victory.

Everything else besides those two things are either in the moment details (like monsters or objectives) or a subset of the bigger picture (rooms, paths, branches, etc).

##Timeline Predictions
This package seems really good. I gave it a quick glimpse and realized all the hard work was done for me. I dont have to create functions to generate paths or even custom interactions, all that stuff is in the package so this might not take a full seven weeks. If not, my plan is to expand on this, maybe by making another game after it, or by hosting it on it's own fully fledged simple website while also expanding on the story and complexity of the challanges.

## Reasoning
This endeavor doesnt solve any issue, but my brother is a coder, so during the course of this class I started talking to him more about random coding things. I brought up that I had a final project where I just had to code something and he said "make a text based rpg". So as an homage to my brother who I love very much, I decided I was going to do this.
