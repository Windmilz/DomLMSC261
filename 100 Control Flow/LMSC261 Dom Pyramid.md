#           Pyramid Scheming

## What did you do?
-  I cried for hours on end. Literally hours. Then I sucked it up and coded a triangle stacker.
### How did you do it?
- Well after I cried for eons I went on stacked overflow and found a tutorial to make a pyramid. I exclaimed that this is way to hard for me to do for homework but I tried my darndest anyways and I failed miserably and I consulted my brother who then told me that I was build the wrong shape. After another mini breakdown I went and found another stacked overflow post that showed me the loop function and how the components worked so I took that loop and adapted to it to my needs.
### the problems you faced
- Besides the problem of building the wrong script (my mind hurts) my biggest problem is scope. Since they aren't any brackets or anything inside idle, seeing the scope is *really* hard and everything breaks or variables aren't defined when they aren't in the right scope, so when I say I spent hours moving things around inside and outside the scope I really did spend hours which leads me to my now very timely ranting session: why don't we use brackets in idLE? Yeah I suppose they're not human friendly, but it makes coding so much nicer to organize and you can actually tell what contains what inside of code. It stops you from putting gobal variables inside of a script and vice versa and we should just use them. That is the end of my rant.
#### *what code you used from others/elsewhere*
- code for the original loop: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19784772/nested-loop-code-to-create-right-triangle-in-python

- and a massive shoutout to my brother for telling me about the scoping errors and running me through arrays even though I didnt use them for this.
