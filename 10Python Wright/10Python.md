- I used the "say" "v" and "o" commands to tell my computer to say some text in a certain voice and convert it into an aiff files
### the problems you faced
- The only real problem I faced was I tried to create the folders inside my LMSC folder inside of the terminal, but I didnt know the commands so I went ahead and just made the files in the Finder

- I wrote all the code myself, no code was pulled from elsewhere
