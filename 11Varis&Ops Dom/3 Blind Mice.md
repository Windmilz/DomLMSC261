#           11 3 Blind Mice

## What did you do?
-  I created a program that formatted the form "3 Blind Mice" using math to calculate how many blind mice I had
### How did you do it?
- I firstly created a variable "mouse" to equal 2+1 and then created a print function that would print my variable mouse, followed by a new column that was indented and contained "Blind" and then followed by another column that was double indented containing the word "Mice"
### the problems you faced
- My real problem is that idLE creates these really dumb arrows to indicate new lines that don't contribute to the code, but actually  *break* the code, and subsequently, makes me want to have a nice *conversation* with whoever thought that was a good idea. I mean its nice to have but couldn't there be an option to remove those when the code is run or executed or even saved? Is that too much to ask? Couldn't they be classified as notations so they dont interfere with the code? Why does this happen? It
s dumb, I think its very stupid and very dumb. It makes me angry.
#### *what code you used from others/elsewhere*
- I wrote all the code myself, no code was pulled from elsewhere.
